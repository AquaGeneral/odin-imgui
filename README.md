This is a (work in progress) wrapper for [dear imgui v1.52](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (based on [cimgui](https://github.com/Extrawurst/cimgui)).

You can download the latest release with pre-built cimgui binaries [here.](https://github.com/ThisDrunkDane/odin-dear_imgui/releases/latest)

Notes:
* Most functions have been wrapped or bound, those missing will either be added by the maintainer over time or by PR (PRs VERY WELCOME)
* Binaries for cimgui are provided in releases, you can build them yourself the binding just expects the .lib to be next to the file.
